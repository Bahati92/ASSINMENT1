  <h1>READING ANDWRITING FOR DYSLEXIA</h1>
  <p>
    <h3>  is a system that will be used to demonstrate the technique for teaching the dyslexic children especially at home environment .the system will help  the parent to know whether their children might be a dyslexic child or not by showing the characteristic of that children as well as through assessment tool that child can perform in the system under the supervision of his / her parent , Also the system will run a short course for those children who are suffering with such problem to support those children in reading and writing .so through that program/course the dyslexic child will learn in such a way that everyone will be reached  according to his / her need. 
Currently, there is no system that support reading and writing for dyslexia, and most of people are not aware about dyslexia problem so that those children with dyslexia are considered as a slow leaner. there fore the technique used to support them in reading and writing is not correct for their problem so that they fail to acquire reading and writing skills. </h3>
<p>
  <h4>
The proposed system will be able to show the appropriate technique for teaching the dyslexia children especially at home environment. the system will start by asses the children to know that if they are dyslexic or not and those with dyslexic will be in special consideration and connected directed to the course in order to get help according to their problem but all of those process require the help and supervision of a parents.
This system has great impact especially in ministry of education because most of children drop to school for the reason of not able to read and write ,and those children who proceed with their study even though they donâ€™t know to read and write they end up school without reaching their goals, since in our education system student perform national examination so those children fail in the exam and stay their home while they need to continue to learn 
</p>.so if this system will be emplimented  all student will acquire reading and writing skill .  and those skills will help them in their learning process.
So that to reach the goal of this project  it need support from all stake holders including ministry of education , department of inclusive education  and developer of the project so that the intended people of the project to be trained how to use the system for the aim of support their children in reading and writing.
